This script is directly inspired by two others, gridlayouts and syncotype. We used both for a while and finally decided to build a tool that better suited our needs.

Here is a small list of what Ingrid delivers :
  * No JS framework dependencies
  * A user friendly way to setup your grid
  * Cookies to save your settings
  * Show and hide your grid instantly with simple Shortcuts
  * One single JS instead of two
  * No need for extra markup or images
